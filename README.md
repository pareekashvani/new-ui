# AI Interface Prototype

A polished, frontend-only prototype of an AI interface that combines the most compelling features from leading AI platforms.

## Research

### AI Platforms Reviewed

#### 1. OpenAI Playground
A comprehensive web interface for experimenting with OpenAI's language models, featuring real-time parameter adjustment and immediate response visualization. Standout features include intuitive prompt editing, model selection, and parameter controls for temperature, max tokens, and other settings.

#### 2. Hugging Face Spaces
A community-driven platform for hosting and sharing AI applications with customizable interfaces. Notable for its diverse model ecosystem, interactive demos, and seamless integration of various AI capabilities in a unified interface.

#### 3. Anthropic Claude UI
An interface designed for interacting with Anthropic's Claude AI, emphasizing safety, user control, and clear conversation management. Features include structured conversation history, safety controls, and clear input/output separation.

#### 4. Microsoft Copilot Lab
An integrated development environment that seamlessly incorporates AI assistance into coding workflows. Standout features include real-time code suggestions, context-aware completions, and smooth integration with development tools.

#### 5. ChatGPT Interface
A conversational AI interface with clean, intuitive design focusing on natural dialogue flow. Key features include conversation threading, message editing, and streamlined interaction patterns.

### Chosen Core Features

Based on the research, I've selected these 6-8 core features to combine into our design:

1. **Model Selector** - Dropdown/sidebar for choosing between different AI models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
2. **Prompt Editor** - Rich text area with save/load functionality for prompt templates
3. **Parameters Panel** - Interactive controls for temperature, max tokens, top-p, and other model parameters
4. **Chat/Output Area** - Clean conversation display with copy and download JSON functionality
5. **Theme Toggle** - Light/dark mode switch with localStorage persistence
6. **Responsive Layout** - Mobile-first design that adapts seamlessly across all device sizes
7. **Template Management** - Save, load, and organize prompt templates with metadata
8. **Accessibility Features** - Full keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and focus management

## Design

### Design System

The interface follows a modern, minimalist design philosophy with:

- **Color Palette**: 
  - Light mode: Clean whites and subtle grays with blue accents
  - Dark mode: Deep grays and blacks with cyan highlights
- **Typography**: System fonts with clear hierarchy
- **Spacing**: Consistent 8px grid system
- **Components**: Rounded corners, subtle shadows, and smooth transitions

### Tailwind Token Mapping

```css
/* Colors */
--primary: #3b82f6 (blue-500)
--primary-dark: #1d4ed8 (blue-700)
--secondary: #64748b (slate-500)
--background: #ffffff (white)
--background-dark: #0f172a (slate-900)
--surface: #f8fafc (slate-50)
--surface-dark: #1e293b (slate-800)

/* Spacing */
--space-xs: 0.25rem (1)
--space-sm: 0.5rem (2)
--space-md: 1rem (4)
--space-lg: 1.5rem (6)
--space-xl: 2rem (8)

/* Typography */
--font-size-sm: 0.875rem (text-sm)
--font-size-base: 1rem (text-base)
--font-size-lg: 1.125rem (text-lg)
--font-size-xl: 1.25rem (text-xl)
```

## Development

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context + useReducer
- **Component Library**: Storybook
- **Deployment**: Vercel

### Implementation Notes

- All components are built with accessibility in mind
- Mock API routes provide realistic data for development
- Theme persistence using localStorage
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- TypeScript strict mode for type safety

### Known Limitations

- Frontend-only prototype (no real AI integration)
- Mock data for models and templates
- Limited to basic parameter controls
- No real-time streaming responses

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Run Storybook:
```bash
npm run storybook
```

4. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel and accessible at: [Live URL will be added after deployment]

### Deployment Instructions

1. **Vercel Deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Install Vercel CLI
   npm i -g vercel
   
   # Deploy
   vercel --prod
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**: No environment variables required for this prototype

3. **Build Configuration**: The project uses Next.js 14 with App Router and is configured for optimal performance
